#### Recognization of good photos for analyzation after doing a Colonoscopy proceder with the help of logistic regression classifier.  

## Description
This project allowes you to built a logistic regression algorithm by training on 63 features from each photo from the colonoscopy proceder. With the help of this algorithm, you can choose which photo to use for analyzation in order for you to get maximum accuracy.

## How to use?
* Clone the project into your local enviroment: git clone https://github.com/ElaAkerman/Colonoscopy-Photos-Classifier.git
* Open main.py file and see the results.
